module TimeIntervals
  ##
  # Iterates over each day between two concrete Times.
  # For regular periods like Daily and Weekly the iteration is fairly straightforward
  # but for Monthly and Yearly periods it has its complexity since they are note
  # regular in duration.
  # This object aims to hide the complexity of iterating through time intervals
  # using the polimorphic :from(starting_at, up_to:) and :next_to(time_interval)
  # methods.
